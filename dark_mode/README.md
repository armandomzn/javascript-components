## Key Concepts:

### JavaScript Functions
  - Theme Toggle:
    - The project toggles between light and dark themes using button clicks.
    - The theme preference is stored in localStorage and applied automatically on page load.
  - Date Display:
    - Displays the current date and subtracts a number of days (from 0 to 10) for each date in a set of elements.
    - Uses Moment.js to format and calculate the date.

### Event Listeners
  - Theme Buttons:
    - Two buttons (light and dark) allow the user to switch between light and dark modes.
    - The theme is applied immediately, and the preference is saved in localStorage.

  - Date Formatting:
    - The dates are generated by looping through elements with the class .date and displaying the formatted date for each.

### LocalStorage
- The theme selection (light or dark) is saved in localStorage to persist the user's preference between page reloads.
- On page load, the theme is applied based on the saved setting.

### Moment.js
- Moment.js is used to handle and format dates, calculating dates in the past by subtracting a number of days from the current date.

### Pure CSS Styling
- Simple and clean design using CSS to style the theme toggle buttons and date display.
