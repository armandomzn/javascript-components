## Key Concepts Across Projects

  - DOM Manipulation: Many of these projects use basic and advanced DOM manipulation techniques, such as adding and removing elements, updating text, and responding to user interactions.
  - API Integration: Some projects, like the Cocktail API, Random Users API, and Norris Jokes, demonstrate how to fetch data from public APIs and display it dynamically.
  - CSS Styling: All projects are styled using pure CSS, with some utilizing CSS variables, media queries, and flexbox/grid for layout.
  - JavaScript Functions: Functions are used extensively for modularity and reuse across different projects. Common patterns include event listeners, data handling, and DOM updates.
