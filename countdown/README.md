## Key Concepts:

### JavaScript Functions
- Uses JavaScript to calculate and display the remaining time dynamically.
- Formats date values to ensure proper display.
- Updates the **DOM** every second with the remaining time.

### Event Listeners
- The script continuously updates the countdown in real-time.
- Once the countdown expires, an expiration message is displayed.

### Date Manipulation
- Retrieves and calculates the difference between the current date and the target date.
- Converts milliseconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Ensures correct formatting for values below 10 (e.g., `09` instead of `9`).

### Pure CSS Styling
- The design is styled using **CSS** only.
- The countdown timer is visually structured using a flexible grid layout.
