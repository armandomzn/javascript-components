## Key Concepts:

### JavaScript Functions
- Displaying Projects:

    - The projects are dynamically rendered in the DOM, displaying each project's name, description, lead, images, and technologies used.

- Filtering Projects:

  - Projects can be filtered based on the technologies used either by typing in the search input or by clicking the technology buttons.
  - The filtering is done by matching the input text or selected technology with the projectâ€™s technologies.

- Search Bar Functionality:

    - The search input allows filtering based on the technologies used. It updates in real-time with a slight delay (debounced) to reduce unnecessary filtering calls.

- Dynamic Technology Buttons:

    - Technology buttons are dynamically generated, allowing users to filter projects based on the selected technology.
### Event Listeners
- Search Input:

    - The search input listens for keyup events and filters the projects based on the technologies used. It includes a 2-second debounce to optimize performance.

- Technology Buttons:

    - The buttons for each technology are dynamically created. Clicking a button will filter the projects based on the selected technology.

### Dynamic Content Rendering
- HTML Templates:
  - The project cards and buttons are dynamically created using JavaScript by mapping over the project data and technology list.

- Filter Logic:
  - The project list is updated based on user interaction with the search input or technology buttons. The projects are filtered by matching the technologies used.

### Pure CSS Styling
- Simple and clean design using pure **CSS** to style the project cards and technology buttons.
