## Key Concepts:

### JavaScript Functions
- Modal Control: The gallery opens the modal when an image is clicked, allowing users to view and navigate through the images.
- Navigation: The modal contains Next and Previous buttons for navigating between images, as well as the ability to select images directly in the modal.

### Event Listeners
- Open Modal: When an image in the gallery is clicked, the modal opens with the selected image.
- Close Modal: The modal can be closed by clicking the close button.
- Next and Previous Buttons: Users can navigate through the images in the modal using the Next and Previous buttons.
- Image Selection: Users can select an image in the modal by clicking on it, updating the main image displayed.

### Modal Behavior
- The modal opens with the selected image and displays all images in the gallery for navigation.
- Users can cycle through the images using the Next and Previous buttons. When the end of the list is reached, the gallery loops back to the first image, and vice versa.

### Pure CSS Styling
- The design is simple, with CSS handling the layout, positioning, and transitions of the modal and gallery images.
