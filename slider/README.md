## Key Concepts:

### JavaScript Functions
- Dynamically updates the DOM to display the current review in the carousel.
- Handles the logic for navigating between reviews and managing their visibility.

### Event Listeners
- Next Button `(nextBtn)`: Click to move to the next review in the carousel.
- Previous Button `(prevBtn)`: Click to go back to the previous review in the carousel.

### Review Carousel Logic
- The carousel auto-advances every 2 seconds but can be manually controlled with the Previous and Next buttons.
- Reviews are hidden or displayed with smooth transitions using CSS properties like opacity, visibility, and transform.

### Pure CSS Styling
- The design is clean and minimalist, with CSS handling the visual presentation and transitions of the review elements.
- CSS transitions are applied to the review slides for smooth visibility changes as the carousel advances.
